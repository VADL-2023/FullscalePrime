KISS TCP: Something unexpected from client application.
Is client app treating this like an old TNC with command mode?
This can be caused by the application sending commands to put a
traditional TNC into KISS mode.  It is usually a harmless warning.
For best results, configure for a KISS-only TNC to avoid this.
In the case of APRSISCE/32, use "Simply(KISS)" rather than "KISS."
